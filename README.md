# Quick Description

**Programmers :shipit:**: Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI from the University of Malaga, Spain. 

**About:** This repositiory contains the implementation in [1] that studies the influence of the mapping functions when handling the binary antenna placement using a conitnuous swarm algorithm.

## **How :green_book:** 

- Depending on the variant you want to execute you just need to navigate to the corresponding foldr: `BFPAs` for the flower pollination algorithm and `PBIL` for the population-based incremental learning.
- Once you have navigated to the folder of the corresponding variant, you just need to execute the file `main.m`.


## **Folders Hiearchy :open_file_folder:**
    
- `BFPAs`:  this folder includes the binary variants of the flower pollination algorithm.

    - `AM`: This folder contains the variant using `Angle Modulation` mapping technique.
    - `GVP`: This folder contains the variant using `Great Value Priority` mapping technique.
    - `Nearest_Integer`: This folder contains the variant using `Nearest integer` mapping technique.
    - `Normalised`: This folder contains the variant using `Normalisation` mapping technique.
    - `Quantum`: This folder contains the variant using `Quantum Inspiration`.
    - `Sigmoid`: This folder contains the variant using `Sigmoid` mapping technique.
- `PBIL`: This folder contains the code of the `Populatio-Based Incremental Learning`.
